# Analysis with data.table
#===========================
install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table) # load up data.table library
setDT(gn) # convert the "data frame" to a "data table"
# https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf

gn # only shows the top and tail

# Let's extract some data from the table

#=== DT[extract-rows] ===
1:5     # gives a sequence of 1,2,3,4,5
gn[1:5] # extract first 5 rows

#=== DT[extract-rows, extract-columns] ===
gn[, .(Title, Amount.Awarded)]    # extract 2 columns by name
gn[1:5, .(Title, Amount.Awarded)] # extract rows by id, columns by name

# with index numbers in a different order
order(-gn$Amount.Awarded) # returns, for each row, the rank in descending order of amount
gn[order(-Amount.Awarded), .(Title,Amount.Awarded)]         # rank order of award by amount
gn[order(-Amount.Awarded), .(Title,Amount.Awarded)][1:10]   # top 10 biggest awards

# with boolean conditions
gn$Award.Date>strftime("2017-01-01") # returns, for each row, true if the date was this year
gn[Award.Date>strftime("2017-01-01"), .(Title,Award.Date)]  # extract awards made this year
gn[Funding.Org.Name=="BBC Children in Need"] # extract awards made by a given funder


#=== DT[extract-rows, calculate-summary] ===
gn[,.N] # count awards with the .N function
gn[Award.Date>strftime("2017-01-01"),.N] # count this years awards
gn[,.(total=sum(Amount.Awarded))] # use the sum function, assign the result into a "total" column

#=== DT[extract-rows, calculate-summary, group-by] ===
gn[,.N,.(Recipient.Region)]       # Number of awards by region
gn[,.(total=sum(Amount.Awarded)),.(Recipient.Region)] # Total award value by region


# Find and extract a column of recipient organisation names
# Which recipient org received the biggest single award?
# Which recipient org received the most awards (by number)?
# Which funding org awarded the most money?
# How many awards were made last year? (hint, there's a year function)

# Visualisation with ggplot2
#===========================
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# An implementation of the grammar of graphics (a language for describing visualisations)
# aesthetic mapping: get from your data (Award.Amount) to something ggplot understand (x axis)
# geoms: visual features used to encode the data (e.g. bar, line or point chart)
# http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/
# https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf
# e.g. ggplot(data, aes(x,y)) + geom_point

#=== Basics of ggplot ===
df <- data.frame(a=10,b=12) # basic example data frame: 1 row, 2 columns
ggplot(df, aes(x=a, y=b)) + geom_point() # map variable a to the x axis, b to y, and render a point 

runif(10) # 10 random numbers (uniformly distributed between 0 and 1) 
df <- data.frame(a=runif(50), b=runif(50), c=1:5)
ggplot(df, aes(a, b, colour=c)) + geom_point() # encode c with colour
# didn't need to specify x and y when they're in the default position 

ggplot(gn, aes(Recipient.Region)) + geom_bar() # Count awards per Region
ggplot(gn, aes(Recipient.Region)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() # Flip to make labels legible (can also zoom)
